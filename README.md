# WindowsPlusPlus
Library for object oriented dialogs

Big thanks to DarthTon's Xenos Injector (https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos) for his pseudo win32++ impl, helped a ton (especially mapping message values to appropriate callbacks with help from his bound member thunking)
and to the creator of WTL:: (http://wtl.sourceforge.net/) For his functions that i started implementing but half way through just ended up copying his impl
